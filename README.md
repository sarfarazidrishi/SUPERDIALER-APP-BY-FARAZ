SuperDialer is a modern, lightning-fast dialer app built with Jetpack Compose and Android Architecture Components.
It’s designed to deliver instant contact access, smooth call history management, and snappy performance through intelligent caching — no more waiting for your contact list to load every time you open the app.

what makes it different from other dialer applications:
>> TAGS:
you can tags to unknown numbers like currier guy, pizza delivery, cab driver, "the guy from that meeting" etc. like this so that you don't have to scratch you head when you see your call logs
>>you can later delete/update those tags
>>Suppose you are someone who often travel back to home at times when its hard to find a cab, if you have any cab driver contact tagged in your dialer, simply tap on the tag(ola, driver, home-to-office) at the top
of the applicatin it will give you all the numbers with that tag. you can ask if he is in the area or would like to drive you to home at cab price, you may even find a friend this way.

>> WHATSAPP :
when we get calls from new businness contacts, and you want to contact him on whatsApp, there is instant whatsapp button in you call logs.

>> NOTES:
YOU CAN ADD NOTES TO CALLS, NUMBERS, CONTACTS. we are forgetful so you can add notes on why someone called you,
suppose you are in businesss, you often get calls like bro, can you pack some 2 pizzas and a wine bottle. instantly note it down in your dialer app, check you notes for all calls deliver, contact them

>> ARCHIEVE: you can archieve calls by selecting the tags and
MAKE YOU CALL LOGS CLEANER.
